The purpose of the experiment is to test the working of the threads along with the behaviour when implemented with infinitely recursive structure. Also, the structure has complex design as we zoom into it. When we want a high resolution image with such minute designs there is always a requirement that it should work faster along with high definition. Therefore, thread help us to make such image faster by use of multiple threads in multithread library.
